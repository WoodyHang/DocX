# DocX
A small framework that converts NSAttributedString to .docx Word files on iOS and macOS.

## Motivation

On iOS, `NSAttributedString.DocumentType` supports only HTML and Rich Text, while on macOS .doc and .docx are available options. Even then the .docx exporter on macOS supports only a subset of the attributes of NSAttributedString. 

This library is used in [SimpleFurigana for macOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/simple-furigana/id997615882?l=en&mt=12) and [SimpleFurigana for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/simple-furigana/id924351286?l=en&mt=8), hence the focus on furigana annotation export.

## Installation

Add 
```
.package(name: "DocX", url: "https://github.com/shinjukunian/DocX.git", .branch("master"))
```

to ```dependencies``` in your  ```Package.swift``` file. This requires Swift 5.3, which shipped with Xcode12.
Alternatively, add  ```DocX``` in Xcode via ```File->Swift Packages->Add Package Dependency```, paste ```https://github.com/shinjukunian/DocX.git``` as URL and specify ```master``` as branch.

## Usage

```swift
let string = NSAttributedString(string: "This is a string", attributes: [.font: UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: UIFont.systemFontSize), .backgroundColor: UIColor.blue])
let url = URL(fileURLWithPath:"myPath")
try? string.writeDocX(to: url)
```

See the attached sample projects (for iOS and macOS) for usage and limitations.
On iOS, DocX also includes a `UIActivityItemProvider` subclass (`DocXActivityItemProvider`) for exporting .docx files through `UIActivityViewController`.

Please note that Quicklook (on both platforms) only supports a limited number of attributes.

## Supported Attributes

- most things in `NSAttributedString.Key` except
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.expansion`
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.kern`
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.ligature`
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.obliqueness`
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.superscript` (macOS only, doesnt really work for most fonts anyway)
  - `NSAttributedString.Key.textEffect`
- `CTRubyAnnotation` for furigana (ruby) annotations in CoreText

Some attributes don't have a direct correspondence. For example `NSAttributedString` does (typically) not have the concept of a page size.  

## Dependencies

- my fork of [AEXML](https://github.com/shinjukunian/AEXML), many thanks to the original author [tadija](https://github.com/tadija/AEXML)
- [ZipArchive](https://github.com/ZipArchive/ZipArchive). I could not get any of the native Swift Zip libraries to work with the .docx folder structure.

## Alternatives

- [WKDocReader](https://github.com/Wekwa/WKDocReader) to read old-school .doc files
- [BSDocxRipperZipper](https://github.com/SlayterDev/BSDocxRipperZipper) which supports both reading and writing, but only for a subset of attributes.
